## Context Clues

When I first started learning React, **Redux** was my holy grail. 
My first React application was a front-end application for a database that contained 
most of the movies/shows in WarnerMedia's expansive catalogue.
I was working with components nested 8-10 levels deep at times and needed a way to manage all of the data efficiently.
Redux was my best-friend, lifeline, and I defended it with every fiber of my being–or at least right up until I learned to use React hooks.

Between **useState()**, **useEffect()** and **useRef()** I was in functional component heaven! –– I just hadn't had a good enough reason to completely get rid of 
Redux and use **React Context**... until today!

Gatsby JS is great, but it recreates the layout component each time you visit a different page.  So I couldn't **useState()** to hold the metadata of the koi fish that will
be swimming in the background of my website.  I decided I would try using **React Context** rather than setting up redux (and maybe saw a few articles online advising me to try this).

Bottom line: **React Context** is quick, easy to use, and will now be my go-to rather than **Redux**.

I created a store, exposed the ```pondData``` and ```setPondData``` variables, added a container component, and passed down the necessary data to both.

The result is exactly what I wanted!  **Efficient global data storage**.  

Out with the old, in with the new.
